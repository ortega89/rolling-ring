# What is that?
This is a simple and sloppy implementation of a popular rolling ring illusion. Each point of the ring oscillates along a straight line, yet the whole picture looks like a big wheel which rolls inside a barrel.

# Can this code be used for other kinds of animation?
Yes, you can try tweaking the constants to generate other rolling stuff. You are not guaranteed to get a good looking result though.
